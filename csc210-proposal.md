# DiscoverMe

**Web Application Name:**

DiscoverMe

**Target Audience:**

Travelers or those looking to discover new things to do

**Problem Intended To Solve:**

When traveling, you often know the major sites to see, but often times the best things to do and places to see are right under your nose.  Yet, you have no idea unless you want to sift through endless pages of google searches or stumble upon it by chance. This application allows those travelling to easily discover things to do and places to go based on their interests as well as deal with the culture shock associated with other areas of the globe.

Similarly, sometimes you live somewhere your whole life and never discover what is nearby.  This will also allow users to discover activities and places that have been hiding just beyond their walls this whole time.

**Minimum Project Compliance:**

**_C_**reate: Users can create an account by entering their name and interests.

**_R_**ead: Users will be able to read about the area they select as well as read through the suggested activities in that area based on their interests.

**_U_**pdate: Users can update their interests as well as add things to do and places to go to their list.  If something they want to do is not already a suggestion, when they add it to their list, it can then be stored in the database as a suggestion for others. 

**_D_**elete: Users will be able to delete their account.  After actually doing the thing or going to that place, the user can then eliminate that item from their list.

**Unique and Creative:**

Allows the user to take a quiz in order to determine the countries that they are most likely to enjoy.  Plan to implement Maps API in order to show users where these places are.  Additionally, when somebody completes something from their list, plan to implement either Facebook/Twitter API in order document their moment on social media.
